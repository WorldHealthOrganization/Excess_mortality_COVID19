# R scripts for estimating WHO excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic

This repository contains R scripts designed to estimate excess mortality associated with the COVID-19 pandemic over 2020-2022. Specifically, it includes scripts that:
* predict expected mortality estimates, e.g. the estimated all-cause mortality that would have been expected if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred;
* predict observed mortality estimates, e.g. the estimated all-cause mortality that have occured during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* calculate and refine excess mortality estimates, taking into account mortality from other shocks unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic for certain countries.

For more details, please refer to the WHO Methods Document available at: https://www.who.int/data/sets/global-excess-deaths-associated-with-covid-19-modelled-estimates *(2)*.

## Dependencies 
R version 3.6.3 and the following R packages: "tidyverse", "posterior", "INLA", "zoo", "readxl", "cmdstanr", "gridExtra", "mgcv", "matrixStats". 

IMPORTANT: The INLA package should be installed as the testing (not stable) branch version 22.05.03, with instructions available at: https://www.r-inla.org/download-install.

## Directories 
* **Expected/** contains R scripts for predicting expected mortality estimates for each year and age/sex categories over 2020-2022, on the basis of pre-pandemic 2000-2019 estimated death counts from *WHO Global Health Estimates*. Please refer to the Section 4 of the Methods document for more details.
* **Observed/** contains R scripts for predicting observed mortality estimates for countries with and without reported data for each year and age/sex categories over 2020-2022. Please refer to the Section 5 of the Methods document for more details.
* **Excess/** contains R scripts for calculating the final excess mortality estimates. Please refer to the Section 2 of the Methods document for more details.
